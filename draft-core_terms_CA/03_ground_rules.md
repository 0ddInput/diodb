To encourage vulnerability research and to avoid any confusion between legitimate research and malicious attack, we ask that you attempt, in good faith, to:

- Play by the rules. This includes following this policy, as well as any other referenced agreements;
- Report any vulnerability youâ€™ve discovered to us promptly;
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience;
- Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with us;
- Keep the details of any discovered vulnerabilities confidential until we have worked out a publication schedule, in accordance with this policy they are fixed, according to the Disclosure Policy;
- Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out-of-scope;
- If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: Limit the amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof of Concept; and cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter any user data during testing, including any proprietary information or data about an identifiable individual, such as financial data, or personal health information;
- You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder; and
- Do not engage in extortion.
