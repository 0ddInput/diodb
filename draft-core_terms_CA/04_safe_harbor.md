We consider vulnerability research that attempts, in good faith, to comply with this policy to be:

- Authorized and with colour of right and, as such, consistent with sections 429(2) and 342.1 of the Criminal Code (and/or similar state laws);
- Authorized to the extent that it would otherwise interfere with any rights granted to us under the Copyright Act [RSC 1985, c C-42,][including ss 3, 15 and 41 of that act], and carried out with our consent [as envisioned by sections 30.63 and 41.15];
- Exempt from any relevant restrictions in our Terms & Conditions, and we waive those restrictions to the extent they are inconsistent with this policy; and
- Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted for our benefit.

This policy prevails over any other inconsistent term or agreement.

We will not initiate or support any legal action against you for any vulnerability research that is consistent with this policy, or for any accidental, good faith violations of this policy. To the extent that some of your vulnerability research falls outside of this policy (e.g. if some of your research impacts out of scope systems) this policy will continue to apply with respect to any of your activities that remain compliant with it.
This policy solely operates as a safe harbour from independent potential legal obligations or liabilities. Failure to comply with this policy will disqualify you from the safe harbour it establishes, but should not be read as creating legal obligations that would not otherwise exist or extending such obligations beyond their independent scope. 
You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws. 

While we may change this policy from time to time, such changes will not be applied retrospectively, and the safe harbour outlined here is irrevocably extended to any vulnerability research that is carried out while this policy remains in effect.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our Official Channels before going any further.
