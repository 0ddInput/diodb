# Disclose.io Terms

> Our Vision: A healthy and ubiquitous Internet Immune System
> Our Mission: To drive vulnerability disclosure adoption through safety, simplicity, and standardization.  

[disclose.io](https://disclose.io) is a collaborative and vendor-agnostic movement that engages security researchers, corporate and independent legal experts, and industry leaders from all around the world. 

The goal of the project is to support the accelerated adoption of vulnerability disclosure best practices including **bi-lateral safe harbor, readability for non-legal and non-native language audiences, and a recognizable mark of solidarity with the disclose.io movement.**  

For a more complete overview of disclose.io, a presentation from GRIMMCon is available [here](https://m.disclose.io/2ZuYjkg), and a video walkthrough of the project is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARWG35whYLs).
