> Driving safety, simplicity, and standardization in vulnerability disclosure.

**disclose.io** is a collaborative and vendor-agnostic project to standardize best practices around safe harbor for good-faith security research.

The project expands on the work done by Bugcrowd and CipherLaw’s [Open Source Vulnerability Disclosure Framework](https://github.com/bugcrowd/disclosure-policy), Amit Elazari’s [#legalbugbounty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fMrZCcshyc), and Dropbox’s [safe harbor blog post](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/03/protecting-security-researchers/), and has since engaged the input of hackers, industry experts, and corporate legal teams from around the world.

The design philosophy of the disclose.io framework is to balance four forces:

- Legal completeness,
- Safe harbor for security researchers,
- Safe harbor for program owners, and
- Readability for those who don’t have a legal background or who don’t speak English as a first language.

Organizations displaying the disclose.io logo are committing to a set of [**Core Terms**](core_terms/) focused on creating safe harbor for good-faith security research. To set the parameters for these core terms, organizations are also required to provide clear definitions regarding the permitted **Scope** for such research, one or more **Official Communication Channels**, and a formal **Disclosure Policy** to meet the requirements of disclose.io

## Requirements

To use disclose.io and associated logos in a security research or disclosure program, organizations must have the following items clearly defined within the context of each disclose.io compliant program:

- **Scope** – A complete list of "In-Scope" properties for which the organizational is explicitly allowing and encouraging good-faith security research, and optionally:
    - **Out-of-Scope** - A non-exhaustive list of systems and security testing activities that the organization strongly wishes to discourage testing against, and
    - **Rewards** – Information on whether or not compensation the program offers payment for valid, unique issues, as well as the type and parameters of that compensation.
- **Official Communication Channels** – A full list of the communication methods that are made available by the organization to receive and communicate about vulnerability submissions.
- **Disclosure Policy** – A clear policy outlining the conditions under which a researcher can disclose the details of a reported issue to third parties. Examples include:
    - **Coordinated Disclosure**: A researcher can share details of the vulnerability after a fix has been applied and the program owner has provided permission to disclose, OR after 90 days from submission, whichever is sooner,
    - **Discretionary Disclosure**: The researcher or the program owner can request mutual permission to share details of the vulnerability after approval is explicitly received, or
    - **Non-Disclosure**: Researchers are required to keep vulnerability details and the existence of the program itself confidential.
    
Examples of these items are available in the [**Additional Terms**](additional_terms/) section of the disclose.io repo.

## Core Terms and Logo Usage

# "Full" Safe Harbor

If the above requirements are met, an organization may display the disclose.io [Core Terms](core_terms/), as well as the disclose.io logo, in conjunction with their authorized security research program's policies to indicate their intention to provide safe harbor for good-faith security research.

# "Partial" Safe Harbor

Organizations that have not met all of the requirements for providing full safe harbor, but do give a clear goodwill statement about not pursuing legal action related to security research, can be acknowledged through the use of the Partial Safe Harbor disclose.io logo.
