# Introduction

The security of our election infrastructure is critical to the integrity of our democracy. Therefore, we value the input of security researchers acting in good faith to help us maintain a high standard for the security of our systems, which in turn gives American voters confidence in our electoral process. This includes encouraging responsible vulnerability research and disclosure. This policy sets out our definition of good faith in the context of finding and reporting vulnerabilities, as well as what you can expect from us in return.

# Scope 

The scope of this policy includes only Internet-accessible election applications and infractructure, including: 
- Voter registration databases, 
- e-Poll books, 
- Election night reporting systems,
- etc... (State or County completes with in-scope domains and system types/categories). 

Any systems not listed above are out-of-scope for security testing under this policy. Any discovered or suspected vulnerabilities in out of scope systems should be reported to the appropriate vendor, or to CERT/CC.

# Out of Scope 

(Optional)

# Rewards 
 
(Optional)

Rewards for vulnerabilities may be awarded at the discretion of the Secretary of State as funds are available. Under this policy, security researchers are not authorized to solicit reward or payment for services rendered as part of the disclosure process.
# Official Communication Channels 

(Required - Email address, web form URL, or platform URL for vulnerability submissions goes here)

# Expectations

When working with us according to this policy, you can expect us to:

- Always hold the integrity of the democractic process as critical to our mission; 
- Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this policy;
- Work with you to understand and validate your report, including a timely initial response to the submission;
- Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities within our budget and operations constraints; and
- Recognize your contribution to improving our security, after remediation and at a time of our choosing if you are the first to report a unique vulnerability, and your report triggers a code or configuration change.

# Ground Rules

To encourage vulnerability research and to avoid any confusion between good-faith hacking and malicious attack, we ask that you:

- Play by the rules. This includes following this policy, as well as any other relevant agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any other relevant terms, the terms of this policy will prevail;
- Report any vulnerability youâ€™ve discovered promptly (Public disclosure of election-related vulnerabilities is not authorized, as it can harm voter confidence and negate the benefits of this policy - This clause will be revised after the 2020 General Elections);
- Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience;
- Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with us;
- Keep the details of any discovered vulnerabilities confidential until they are fixed, according to the Disclosure Policy;
- Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out-of-scope;
- You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder; and
- Do not solicit payment in exchange for your services. 

If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: 
- Cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter any user or voter data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII); 
- Limit the amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof of Concept; 
- Avoid downloading or extracting data of any kind - A screenshot of 3-5 records is sufficient for your Proof of Concept; 

While we will always strongly consider your assessment and recommendations regarding vulnerability severity, we retain the authority to determine what vulnerabilities can and should be remediated and in what time frame. We will always prioritize our mission to administer fair elections, and will address vulnerabilities to the best of our ability to achieve that goal. 

# Safe Harbor

When conducting vulnerability research according to this policy, we consider this research to be:

- Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) (and/or similar state laws), and we will not initiate or support legal action against you for accidental, good faith violations of this policy;
- Exempt from the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), and we will not bring a claim against you for circumvention of technology controls;
- Exempt from restrictions in our Terms & Conditions that would interfere with conducting security research, and we waive those restrictions on a limited basis for work done under this policy; and
- Lawful, helpful to the overall security of the Internet, and conducted in good faith.

You are expected, as always, to comply with all applicable laws.

If at any time you have concerns or are uncertain whether your security research is consistent with this policy, please submit a report through one of our Official Channels before going any further.

# Disclosure Policy

Because of the sensitive nature of election security, we only authorize discretionary disclosure. 

Discretionary Disclosure: The researcher or the program owner can request mutual permission to share details of the vulnerability after approval is explicitly received from the Secretary of State for the state affected by the vulnerability.
