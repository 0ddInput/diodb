Disclose.io is a collaborative and vendor-agnostic project to standardize best practices around safe harbour for good-faith security research, and expands on the work done by Bugcrowd and CipherLaw's [Open Source Vulnerability Disclosure Framework](https://github.com/bugcrowd/disclosure-policy), Amit Elazari's [#legalbugbounty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fMrZCcshyc), and Dropbox's [recent blog post](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2018/03/protecting-security-researchers/).

The design philosophy of the disclose.io framework is to balance four forces:
- Legal completeness,
- Safe harbor for security researchers,
- Safe harbor for program owners, and 
- Readability for those who don’t have a legal background or who who don’t speak English as a first language.

Organizations displaying the Disclose.io logo are committing to a set of **Core Terms** focused on creating safe harbor for good-faith security research. In order to uphold this commitment, such organizations are also required to provide clear definitions regarding the permitted **Scope** for such research, one or more **Official Communication Channels**, and a formal **Disclosure Policy**.
